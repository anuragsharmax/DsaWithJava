# DSA with Java
open src for codes and notes
This repository contains my structured preparation for  
**Data Structures and Algorithms using Java**.

The focus of this repo is:
- Strong fundamentals
- Clear logic
- Topic-wise organization
- Self-written revision notes

This is a learning-focused repository, not copy-paste solutions.

##  Structure

The repository is organized topic-wise:



Each topic may contain:
- `core` → basic concepts / standard algorithms  
- `problems` → variations and practice problems  
- `README.md` → personal notes for revision  

---

##  Learning Philosophy

- Understand first, then optimize
- Prefer clarity over clever tricks
- Write code that I can explain confidently in interviews
- One meaningful commit per study session

---

## Language Used
- Java

## Note to Self

This repository is meant for:
- Daily practice
- Fast revision
- Long-term consistency

Progress matters more than perfection.
